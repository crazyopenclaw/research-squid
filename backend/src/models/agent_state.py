LangGraph state definitions for the research institute orchestration.

InstituteState is the top-level state that flows through the LangGraph
state machine. It holds coordination data (IDs, counters, flags) — all
actual artifact data lives in Neo4j and Postgres.

SquidState tracks an individual line of inquiry assigned to a
Squid agent, including its persona for behavioral customization.
